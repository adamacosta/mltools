Required for analysis:

Model Complexity Curve
======================

Should have an error metric on the Y axis and complexity measure on the X axis.
What this is will be different for different models and should be fully
configurable, allowing the comparison of any complexity measure and any error
measure returned by the modeling package. Should output both the training error
and the cross-validation error.

* Decision Trees - Max depth, minimum observations in node
* Neural Networks - Number of hidden-layers, number of hidden layer units
* kNN - Value of k, distance metric, kernel function
* SVM - Kernel function, cost measure
* Boosting - Number of base learners, which base learner

Learning Curve
==============

Error metric on Y axis and size of dataset on X axis. Like complexity curve, should
return both the training error and the cross-validation error. In this case,
complexity or tuning parameters are fixed and we vary only the size of the data
used.
